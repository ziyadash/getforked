creator side: 
- activate an election (turn into a live session)
- accept users into the .voters field (emit a session code for users to join with)
- when session is stopped, we deactivate the sesssion

voter side:
- register as a user
- join a vote by entering the session code emitted above

voting process:
- Question object contain an array of ballots
- a voter submits their ballot, which is an array of the candidates for that particular question
- we can have logic for counting votes based on preferential voting from this array of ballots, for every question
